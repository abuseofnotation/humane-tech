title: Humane technology
---

It is a well-known engineering principle, that you should always use the *weakest* technology capable of solving your problem - the weakest technology is likely the cheapest, easiest to maintain, extend or replace and there are no sane arguments for using anything else.

In particular, the hostility of car-centered cities is well studied by people like *Jan Gehl* one of the founders of the "new urbanism" movement that advocates creating infrastructures that prioritize cyclists and pedestrians (by the way, one of his books is called "Cities for People" - which is pretty close to "humane tech").


Marshal McLuhan theoretizes that we perceive technologies as extensions of ourselves. The idea of humane technology is nothing more than a plead for us to acknowledgement this fact.
