The process which gradually turns humane technologies to inhumane ones is the process of *adding more and more features*, and in general adding more and more technologies to a given process which can often be carried out just as efficiently without them. Marketing and advertising industries do a good job of convincing people that they need those technologies and feature, often up to the point when the mere act of not using them can get people to call you names.

A good example of a human technology are bicycles. The diamond-frame bicycle design that we use today is due to the 1880s. Then it was known as "safety bike", due to the fact that it was safer than the older bike designs (like the one with the huge front-wheel.) Today, such bike would be categorized as a *fixed-gear bicycle*, due to the fact that it lacks a *freewheel mechanism* i.e. if the wheels are spinning, the pedals are spinning too.
