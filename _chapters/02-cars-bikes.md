title: "Humane and non-humane technologies. Technological escapism"
---

Until about 40 years ago, cars were considered the symbol of progress and of the direction where technology is heading, and to some extend they still are, however people are becoming increasingly aware that "there is something rotten" with cars. Cars wouldn't exist without capitalism (and you might say that capitalism as we know it also depends in many ways on cars) and cars are a non-humane technology.

Here are some of the downsides of using cars: 

- Cars are based on technology, which in many cases is more complex that it needs to be. 
- The car is the most expensive good which a person can buy. 
- The more people in a given city have cars, the harder it is to travel in and out of the city, not only by car but by using any other means of transportation. 
- Cars are amongst the most dangerous modes of transportation. 
- Cars also pollute our environment and, without causing it directly are probably one of the top reasons for the issue with obesity.

An much better alternative to cars, especially for city commuting, are bikes:

- Bikes are healthy and eco-friendly, 
- They have good benefits for physical and mental health. 
- Bikes are cheap, accessible and also simple - most people can fix most of their issues with their bikes by themselves. 
- There is a great sense of community between bikers, whereas car drivers are generally very rude with one another.

The biggest downside of using bikes: bikers are much more affected by their environment - they cannot make due without good infrastructure - they need bike lanes, places to store their bikes etc. They have to rely on the strength of their bodies to get to where they are headed, they have to rely on other people, complete strangers to keep them safe, when riding at the street.

Unlike bikes, cars seem like a mode of transportation which generally shields its passengers from their environment: once you are in a car, you can move great distances relatively authonomously and without regard for the environment in which you are moving in. Cars give you the privilege to even ignore certain issues which you would otherwise have. You can, for example, live in a very dangerous or depressing neighbourhood, but that wouldn't make much of a difference for you if you are only travelling there by car.

But though the protection that cars provide is real, the feeling of independence that they induce is a sham - the posession of a car brings about as large amount of dependencies that a consumer product can: oil companies, insurance companies, repair shops etc. all exist because of our car-related needs, needs that not only make us dedicate a great amount of our labor to serving those organizations' interests but, more importantly, increase amount of labour that we should perform, period. In effect, the superficial independence which cars give us, is at the cost of a *much more deeper dependence*. A dependence which is not between people, but between individuals and organizations that are directly and indirectly involved in the car business. Those organizations that have an agenda on their own and ways to preserve themselves even at the cost of the wellbeing of their clients. This dependence, as we said is the main characteristic of technologies that are not humane, and it cannot be justified by any of the benefits that the technology brings. We will look why in the next section.

The influence of non-humane technology to our environment
---

Many technologies that are not humane are justified with the following point: "Sure, I agree that tech X is unpleasant/polluting/ugly, but look how *efficient* it is. If we use it we would produce so much stuff/save so much time that it is worth it."

I am not saying that this kind of thinking is always wrong, but we have to consider how the technology choices that we make influence our environment - *non-humane technologies are hostile towards humans and the environment that is shaped by such technologies is also hostile.* For cars this effect is painfully obvious. The hostility of car-centered cities is well studied by people like *Jan Gehl* who is one of the founders of the "new urbanism" movement that advocates creating infrastructures that prioritize cyclists and pedestrians. And many other non-humane technologies, produce similar results in other respects i.e. a world that is dominated by non-humane technologies is a non-humane world, and any superficial benefits that such technologies bring cannot justify this damage.

If social structures are viewed as technologies, then *capitalism can be seen as a non-humane technology by many people*. And many times people defend capitalism with the argument that I outlined above - although they find it less than favourable, they put up with it due to the benefits it brings.

Capitalism again

The fact that people find capitalism less than favourable is proven by their thirst for more money, *money being often seen as a way to escape from all of its dependencies*. Should you take the job that is most fit for you, or the one which pays better? Some people would try to convince you is that more money is always better by suggesting that you should make enough money so you can do 'whatever you want'" 

This seems like a weird thought. In a healthy environment, people would already be doing what they want i.e. things that are meaningful and helpful for their society. 

Although we need money to survive, you theoretically don't have to be rich to do what you want. Unless what you want, what we all want is *to escape*, to not have to participate in society, as it is organized now.
