Most of us agree that climate change is real. There are still many unanswered questions related to it, (as "How dangerous would it be?", "To what extend it is caused by us?" etc.), but while all these would be good to know, we have a more urgent things to do - if I tell you that there is a stone that is about to fall on your head that weights between 1 and 100 kilograms, your reaction wouldn't be to try to spend time determining the exact size of the stone, neither would you ask who's fault it is that it is there. You would just move (and that is what we, should do as a society.)

Obviously the solution of the problem has to do with *technology*  and so many companies are trying to jump on that bandwagon and invent new less-polluting technologies that we call *green technologies*. But many of these technologies are green only by name - they don't have enough impact on the carbon emisions to constitute a solution to climate change and by claiming to doing so, they are essentially exploiting the people's desire to save the planet in order to make profit.

Developing new technology is not a bad thing, but let's not forget that *developing new technology is what got us here in the first place* - if it weren't for the technologies developed in the last 100-200 years, climate change wouldn't have been an issue.


Instead of less-wasteful production, less production.

Instead of less-polluting products, less products.
